  <mail:subject>Welcome to Atlas</mail:subject>

  <mail:body>
Dear #{event.name},

Someone, presumably you, have requested to reset the password of your Atlas account.

If you did not make this request, please simply disregard this e-mail; it is sent only to
the address on file for your Atlas account, and will become invalid after 48 hours, so you
do not have to worry about your account being taken over.

To choose a new password, please go to the following URL:

http://localhost:8080#{contextPath}/auth/validate.html?key=#{event.key}

Thank you for using Atlas and we wish you much success with your projects.

Sincerely,

The Atlas Team
