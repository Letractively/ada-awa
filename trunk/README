Ada Web Application

Ada Web Application is a framework to build a Web Application in Ada 2005/2012.

It integrates the following projects:

 - ASF           (http://code.google.com/p/ada-asf)
 - ADO           (http://code.google.com/p/ada-ado)
 - Ada Util      (http://code.google.com/p/ada-util)
 - Ada EL        (http://code.google.com/p/ada-el)
 - Ada Security  (http://code.google.com/p/ada-security)
 - Dynamo        (http://code.google.com/p/ada-gen)

 These projects are provided as tarball in 'distrib' directory.
 These projects are distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

AWA relies on the following external projects:

 - AWS      (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/)
 - XMLAda   (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/xmlada/)

 These projects are provided as tarball in 'external' directory.
 They are distributed under different licenses (GNU GPL).
 They are not compiled.

The AWA framework integrates a set unit tests and provides a framework
to build unit tests for AWA applications.   The unit tests are based on
Ada Util test framework which itself is built on top of the excellent
Ahven test framework (Ahven sources is integrated in Ada Util).
You may get Ahven or Aunit at:

 - Ahven    (http://ahven.stronglytyped.org/)
 - AUnit    (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aunit/)


Extract the sources and configure by using:

   ./configure  --enable-ahven


If you want to build AWS, XMLAda or AUnit, you can configure with:


   ./configure --enable-aunit --enable-xmlada --enable-aws


Then, build the packages by using:

   make
