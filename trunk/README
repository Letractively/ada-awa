Ada Web Application

Ada Web Application is a framework to build a Web Application in Ada 2005/2012.

It integrates the following projects:

 - ASF           (http://code.google.com/p/ada-asf)
 - ADO           (http://code.google.com/p/ada-ado)
 - Ada Util      (http://code.google.com/p/ada-util)
 - Ada EL        (http://code.google.com/p/ada-el)
 - Ada Security  (http://code.google.com/p/ada-security)
 - Dynamo        (http://code.google.com/p/ada-gen)

 These projects are provided as tarball in 'distrib' directory.
 These projects are distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

AWA relies on the following external projects:

 - AWS      (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aws/)
 - XMLAda   (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/xmlada/)

 These projects are provided as tarball in 'external' directory.
 They are distributed under different licenses (GNU GPL).
 They are not compiled.

The AWA framework integrates a set unit tests and provides a framework
to build unit tests for AWA applications.   The unit tests are based on
Ada Util test framework which itself is built on top of the excellent
Ahven test framework (Ahven sources is integrated in Ada Util).
You may get Ahven or Aunit at:

 - Ahven    (http://ahven.stronglytyped.org/)
 - AUnit    (http://libre.adacore.com/libre/tools/aunit/)


If XML/Ada and AWS are already installed in your environment, configure,
build and install as follows:

   ./configure  --prefix=/usr/local
   make
   make install

If you don't have XML/Ada or AWS, you must build them and install them first.
You can use the XML/Ada and or AWS packages provided in the 'external' directory.
To do this, run the configure as follows:

   ./configure --enable-xmlada --enable-aws

This will extract and configure XML/Ada in 'xmlada' and AWS in 'aws'.
You will then have to build these packages as follows:

  cd xmlada && make && make install

  cd aws && make prefix="/usr/local" setup build install

After you have built XML/Ada and AWS, you must then configure, build
and install as follows:

   ./configure  --prefix=/usr/local
   make
   make install
