AUnit is a set of Ada packages based on the xUnit family of unit test
frameworks (see www.xprogramming.com/software).  It's intended as a
developer's tool to facilitate confident writing and evolution of Ada
software.  It is purposely lightweight, as one of its main goals is to
make it easy to develop and run unit tests, rather than to generate
artifacts for process management.  The framework supports easy
composition of sets of unit tests to provide flexibility in
determining what tests to run for a given purpose.

AUnit also supports restricted run-time profiles such as ZFP and the
"cert" profile for PSC 653.
