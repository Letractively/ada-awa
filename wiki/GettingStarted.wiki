#summary Getting Started with AWA


= Creating a project =

First, you will use the `dynamo` command to create your new project.
You must choose a project name.  This must be a valid Ada identifier
as it will be used for the application root package name.
The project files are created in the current directory.

{{{
dynamo create-project atlas
}}}

Once the project is created, it is ready to be configured, built and
executed.  The new project has the following structure:

||bin||Directory which will contain the application server||
||src||The application sources (Ada)||
||web||The presentation pages (HTML, XHTML, Javascript, ...)||
||web/css||The CSS presentation pages ||
||web/images||The application images||
||bundles||The resource bundles for application localization||

= Configuring the project =

Your new project must be configured:

{{{
./configure
}}}

= Building the project =

The project contains a Makefile as well as a GNAT project file.
The Makefile will invoke `gnatmake` to build the application.

{{{
make
}}}

You may also invoke `gnatmake` directly.  The GNAT project has the
name of the application.

{{{
gnatmake -Patlas
}}}

= Running the project =

Once the project is built, the `bin` directory will contain the
application server.  You just have to execute it.  The application server
contains the name of your project.

{{{
bin/atlas-server
}}}

When the server starts, it prints some log messages and one of them
tells you the URL you should connect to.

{{{
[2011-09-10 20:35:43] INFO  - Atlas.Server - Connect you browser to: http://localhost:8080/atlas/index.html
}}}

Point your browser to that URL to look at the page.

= Adding a new page =

Adding a new page is quite easy.  You just have to create a new XHTML file
somewhere in the `web` directory.  To help you, you can use `dynamo` to
create a page that you can modify.  When you invoke the following command:

{{{
dynamo add-page main
}}}

The file `web/main.xhtml` is created and your application server will now
expose a new web page `main.html`.
