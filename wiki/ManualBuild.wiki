#summary Manual build of AWA packages

This page tries to explain how to build various packages
used by AWA manually.

A support script is provided in ada-awa-all to help in this task.
It can be used on Unix platforms as well as on Windows.

= Edit configuration =

Go in the `support` directory
{{{
  cd support

Check and modify the configuration by editing the file `build.config`.
  * Check the *PREFIX* variable which indicates where the packages will be installed.
  * Check that the PATH variable is correct
