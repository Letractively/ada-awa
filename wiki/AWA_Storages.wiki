#summary Storage module

== Introduction ==
The <b>Storages</b> module provides a set of storage services allowing an application
to store data files, documents, images in a persistent area.  The persistent store can
be on a file system, in the database or provided by a remote service such as
Amazon Simple Storage Service.

== Creating a storage ==
A data in the storage is represented by a `Storage_Ref` instance.  The data itself
can be physically stored in a file system (`FILE` mode), in the database (`DATABASE`
mode) or on a remote server (`URL` mode).  To put a file in the storage space, first create
the storage object instance:

{{{
  Data : AWA.Storages.Models.Storage_Ref;
}}}

Then setup the storage mode that you want.  The storage service uses this information
to save the data in a file, in the database or in a remote service (in the future).
To save a file in the store, we can use the `Save` operation of the storage service.
It will read the file and put in in the corresponding persistent store (the database
in this example).

{{{
  Service.Save (Into => Data, Path => Path_To_The_File,
                Storage => AWA.Storages.Models.DATABASE);
}}}

Upon successful completion, the storage instance `Data` will be allocated a unique
identifier that can be retrieved by `Get_Id` or `Get_Key`.

== Getting the data ==
Several operations are defined to retrieve the data.  Each of them has been designed
to optimize the retrieval and

  * The data can be retrieved in a local file.    This mode is useful if an external program must be launched and be able to read    the file.  If the storage mode of the data is `FILE`, the path of the file on    the storage file system is used.  For other storage modes, the file is saved    in a temporary file.  In that case the `Store_Local` database table is used    to track such locally saved data.

  * The data can be returned as a stream.    When the application has to read the data, opening a read stream connection is    the most efficient mechanism.

=== Local file ===
To access the data by using a local file, we must define a local storage reference:

{{{
  Data : AWA.Storages.Models.Store_Local_Ref;
}}}

and use the `Load` operation with the storage identifier.  When loading locally we
also indicate whether the file will be read or written.  A file that is in `READ` mode
can be shared by several tasks or processes.  A file that is in `WRITE` mode will have
a specific copy for the caller.  An optional expiration parameter indicate when the
local file representation can expire.

{{{
  Service.Load (From => Id, Into => Data, Mode => READ, Expire => ONE_DAY);
}}}

Once the load operation succeeded, the data is stored on the file system and
the local path is obtained by using the `Get_Path` operation:

{{{
  Path : constant String := Data.Get_Path;
}}}
