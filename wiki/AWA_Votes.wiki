#summary Module votes

== Introduction ==
The <b>Votes</b> module allows users to vote for objects defined in the application.
Users can vote by setting a rating value on an item (+1, -1 or any other integer value).
The Votes module makes sure that users can vote only once for an item.  A global rating
is associated with the item to give the vote summary.  The vote can be associated with
any database entity and it is not necessary to change other entities data model.

== Integration ==
To add the <b>Votes</b> module in an application, the <tt>Vote_Module</tt> instance must
be declared and registered in the AWA application.

=== Vote Beans ===
The <b>Vote_Bean</b> is a bean intended to be used in presentation files (facelet files)
to vote for an item.  The managed bean can be easily configured in the application XML
configuration file.  The <b>permission</b> and <b>entity_type</b> are the two properties
that should be defined in the configuration.  The <b>permission</b> is the name of the
permission that must be used to verify that the user is allowed to vote for the item.
The <b>entity_type</b> is the name of the entity (table name) used by the item.
The example below defines the bean <tt>questionVote</tt> defined by the question module.

{{{
  <managed-bean>
    <description>The vote bean that allows to vote for a question.</description>
    <managed-bean-name>questionVote</managed-bean-name>
    <managed-bean-class>AWA.Votes.Beans.Votes_Bean</managed-bean-class>
    <managed-bean-scope>request</managed-bean-scope>
    <managed-property>
      <property-name>permission</property-name>
      <property-class>String</property-class>
      <value>answer-create</value>
    </managed-property>
    <managed-property>
      <property-name>entity_type</property-name>
      <property-class>String</property-class>
      <value>awa_question</value>
    </managed-property>
  </managed-bean>
}}}

The vote concerns entities for the <tt>awa_question</tt> entity table.
The permission <tt>answer-create</tt> is used to verify for the vote.
