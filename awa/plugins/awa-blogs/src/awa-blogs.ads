--  == Introduction ==
--  The *blogs* plugin is a small blog application which allows users to publish articles.
--  A user may own several blogs, each blog having a name and its own base URI.  Within a blog,
--  the user may write articles and publish them.  Once published, the articles are visible to
--  anonymous users.
--
--  The *blogs* plugin uses the [AWA_Tags] and [AWA_Comments] modules to allow to associate
--  tags to a post and allow users to comment on the articles.
