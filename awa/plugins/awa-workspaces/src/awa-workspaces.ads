--  == Introduction ==
--  The *workspaces* plugin defines a workspace area for other plugins.
--  The workspace is intended to link together all the data objects that an application
--  manages for a given user or group of users.  A workspace is a possible mechanism
--  to provide and implement multi-tenancy in a web application.  By using the workspace plugin,
--  application data from different customers can be kept separate from each other in the
--  same database.
